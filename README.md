# What does this version have?

The new version of the game has been improved with the inclusion of a `setup installer`, which makes it easy to manage files and uninstall the game easily and smoothly. In addition, character `dialogs` are now available in Spanish, which enriches the gaming experience for Spanish-speaking players.

# How can I put the Spanish language in the game?

Good to put the `Spanish language` in the game at the time of starting for the first time you will get an option to select versions and you give it where it says `English` and ahi and the spagnol language will be applied.

**Warning ⚠**

The `Spanish language` only applies to the dialogues of the characters, it is not applied in the game menu because this version does not seek to completely modify the game, only the dialogues.

# Does the game have viruses?

We don't have any knowledge of that `information` because the only thing we did was develop the game `installer` and modify the language `json`, we didn't modify the base game

# Important

The game's dialogues in `Spanish are not 100%` translated, they are `15.37% translated`, but if you want to help us you can enter the repository to the following file
